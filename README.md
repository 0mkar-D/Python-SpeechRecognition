# Python-SpeechRecognition

Mostly the code is pre-defined...

imported speech_recognition library...

used functions like recognizer(), microphone() from the above library...

Rest of the code is self-explanantory...

Tried adding a GUI for the same, but wasn't so well accustomed to tkinter...

Thank you for reading :D
